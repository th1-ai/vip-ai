# Connecting your systems

Every connector in this repo is one of three things, and the table says which.
We will not tell you an integration exists when it does not.

| Badge | Means |
|---|---|
| **built** | Written against the real API and tested against it. |
| **universal** | Works with any system through a common protocol: IMAP/SMTP, CSV, a webhook. |
| **stub** | Interface only. Calling it raises a clear error with a recipe for adding it. |

Check what is actually working on your machine at any time:

```bash
make doctor
```

**What VIP AI actually uses.** Three of the four adapters below: **PMS**
(reads upcoming arrivals and guest history; writes a preference note back to
the reservation via `tools/vip.py capture`), **Messaging** (the guarded
`notify_staff` call that gets an approved brief to the duty team), and
**Sheets** (the follow-on export to whatever reads a shared sheet as "the
housekeeping app" - `review_notify.duty_team_sheet`). It does not use Email
at all — no VIP brief or letter is ever sent to a guest's inbox; a letter's
"send" is a print-ready file in `data/exports/letters/`, not an email (see
`docs/how-it-works.md`). `pos`, `accounting`, `reviews`, `calendar`,
`payments` and `procurement` are unused stubs, same as every repo in this
family. `locks` is unused too; `courier` gets one real call, for a postal
letter's shipment record, and is expected to raise `AdapterNotImplemented` —
see "Everything else" below.

## Status

### PMS - `systems.pms.adapter`

| Adapter | Status | Needs | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mock` | universal | nothing | Reads `fixtures/hotel/*.json`. What `make demo` uses. |
| `csv` | universal | a CSV export | Reads `data/imports/*.csv`. **Start here.** Works with every PMS. |
| `cloudbeds` | built | OAuth app + refresh token | Live reads and writes. |
| `cli` | universal | a JSON-speaking CLI | Advanced. Bridges to a vendor command line tool. |

**`csv` - the one that always works.** Export from your PMS and drop the files in
`data/imports/`:

- `reservations.csv` - `id, status, check_in, check_out, room_type_id,
  room_type_name, room_id, adults, children, source, total, balance, currency,
  guest_email, guest_first_name, guest_last_name, guest_phone, guest_country,
  guest_notes, tier, stays`
- `guests.csv` - `id, first_name, last_name, email, phone, country, language, vip, notes, tier, stays`
- `rooms.csv` - `id, name, max_occupancy, count, rank`
- `rates.csv` - `date, room_type_id, price, currency, min_los, available, closed`

Headers are matched loosely: `checkIn`, `check_in` and `Check In` all work, and
extra columns are kept. Dates must be `YYYY-MM-DD`. Only `reservations.csv` is
required; the rest add capability.

**VIP AI reads three extra columns off `reservations.csv`, not `guests.csv`.**
`tools/vip.py sync` builds each VIP profile from `list_arrivals()`, which
reads `reservations.csv` only — a `guests.csv` row is never joined onto it.
So the columns that seed tier, stay count and the privacy guardrail must sit
on the **reservation** row:

- `tier` - `Platinum` / `Gold` / `Silver` (any case). If the column is blank
  or missing, the tier is worked out from `stays` against
  `config/agent.yaml: tiers.platinum_min_stays` / `tiers.gold_min_stays`
  instead.
- `stays` - the guest's total stay count on file (an integer). Defaults to
  `1` when the column is blank or missing.
- `guest_notes` (also accepted: `guest_note`, `profile_notes`) - free text
  about the guest, not the reservation. Seeds `history_note` on the profile
  the first time it is synced, and is what the privacy guardrail
  (`private`/`discreet`/`never post`/`no publicity` - see `docs/safety.md`)
  scans. Keep the reservation's own booking `notes` column (special
  requests, etc.) separate from `guest_notes`.

Every other column on `reservations.csv` and `guests.csv` survives too, on
`Guest.extra` / `Reservation.extra` (a plain dict of the raw row), even if
this repo does not read it by name - see "Implement your own" below if you
want to wire one in.

In CSV mode the agent cannot write back to your PMS, so anything it wants to
change is appended to `data/exports/pms_writes.csv` with everything a person
needs to apply it by hand. That is a feature: it is how you check the agent's
judgement before you give it write access.

**`cloudbeds`.** Create an app in the Cloudbeds developer portal, authorise it
once against your property, and put the result in `.env`:

```
CLOUDBEDS_CLIENT_ID=
CLOUDBEDS_CLIENT_SECRET=
CLOUDBEDS_REFRESH_TOKEN=
CLOUDBEDS_PROPERTY_ID=
```

Scopes: `read:reservation`, `write:reservation`, `read:guest`, `read:room`,
`read:rate`, `write:rate`, `read:hotel`. The access token refreshes itself.

**`cli`.** If your PMS already has a command line tool that prints JSON, point at
it. See the profiles at the top of `core/adapters/pms_cli.py`.

### Email - `systems.email.adapter`

| Adapter | Status | Needs | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mock` | universal | nothing | Reads `fixtures/inbound/*.eml` and `*.json`. |
| `imap` | universal | mailbox + app password | Any provider. **Start here.** |
| `gmail` | built | Google OAuth desktop client | Adds Gmail labels and threads. |

**`imap`.** In `.env`:

```
EMAIL_ADDRESS=reservations@example.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=            # an APP password, never your login password
IMAP_HOST=imap.example.com
SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
SMTP_PORT=587              # 587 STARTTLS, 465 implicit TLS
```

Google, Microsoft and Fastmail all issue app-specific passwords. Two-factor stays
on and you can revoke the password without touching the account.

Replies carry `In-Reply-To` and `References`, so they land inside the guest's
existing thread rather than starting a new one.

**`gmail`.** Google Cloud Console: enable the Gmail API, configure the consent
screen, create an OAuth client of type **Desktop app**, download the JSON to
`credentials.json`. Then `pip install google-api-python-client google-auth-oauthlib`
and run `make doctor`; a browser opens once and writes `token.json`. Scopes:
`gmail.readonly`, `gmail.send`, `gmail.modify`.

### Messaging - `systems.messaging.adapter`

| Adapter | Status | Needs | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mock` | universal | nothing | Reads `fixtures/inbound/messages.json`. |
| `unipile` | built | your own UniPile account | WhatsApp on your own number. |
| `webhook` | universal | any URL | POST to Zapier, Make, n8n, or your own endpoint. |

**`unipile`.** You create the account, you connect your number by QR code, you
own the credentials: `UNIPILE_DSN`, `UNIPILE_API_KEY`, `UNIPILE_ACCOUNT_ID`.
WhatsApp Business policy limits what you may send outside a guest-initiated
window; read your provider's rules before turning this on.

**`webhook`.** The simplest possible outbound: set `MESSAGING_WEBHOOK_URL` and
the agent POSTs `{chat_id, text, kind, hotel, sent_at}`. Your automation tool
delivers it however you like. Send-only.

### Sheets - `systems.sheets.adapter`

| Adapter | Status | Needs | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `csv` | universal | nothing | Writes `data/exports/<sheet>.csv`. |
| `google` | built | service account JSON | A live shared spreadsheet. |

For `google`: enable the Sheets API, create a service account and a JSON key,
save it as `service_account.json`, and share your spreadsheet with the service
account's email address as an Editor. Set `systems.sheets.spreadsheet_id` to the
long id from the sheet's URL.

### Everything else

`pos`, `accounting`, `reviews`, `calendar`, `payments`, `procurement` and `locks`
are **stubs**: the interface exists, nothing is implemented. Calling one raises an
error that tells you exactly this. If your agent needs one, use the recipe below.

`courier` is also a stub, but VIP AI actually calls it once: when a
handwritten letter's `delivery.channel` is `postal`, `tools/letters.py`
tries `courier.create_shipment()` after writing the print-ready file. It is
expected to raise `AdapterNotImplemented` — this repo does not ship a
pen-plotter or postal-courier integration for any vendor — and the error is
caught and printed, never swallowed. Wire in your own courier's API using
the recipe below, or keep handing the printed file to your own mail process
by hand.

## Implement your own

<a id="implement-your-own"></a>

The interface is small on purpose, and your Claude Code session can do this with
you in an afternoon. Open `claude` in this folder and paste:

> Read `docs/integrations.md#implement-your-own` and `core/adapters/base.py`.
> I need a PMS adapter for **<your system>**. Its API docs are at **<url>** and
> I have credentials in `.env` as `<VAR names>`. Copy `core/adapters/pms_csv.py`
> as the shape, implement `ping`, `capabilities` and the read methods first,
> register it in `core/adapters/__init__.py`, and stop before the write methods
> so I can check the reads with `make doctor`.

### The five steps

**1. Copy the closest existing adapter.**
`core/adapters/pms_csv.py` for a PMS, `email_imap.py` for a mailbox,
`messaging_webhook.py` for a chat channel. They are short and heavily commented.

**2. Implement `ping()` and `capabilities()` first.**

```python
def ping(self) -> HealthCheck:
    """Never raises. Returns ok=False with a fix_hint a hotel can act on."""

def capabilities(self) -> set[str]:
    """The method names that actually do something on this adapter."""
```

`make doctor` reads both. Getting them right first means the rest of the work has
a feedback loop.

**3. Implement the reads.** Map the vendor's fields onto the dataclasses in
`core/adapters/base.py` (`Reservation`, `Guest`, `RoomType`, `RateRow`,
`EmailMessage`, `ChatMessage`). Put anything you do not map into `.extra` rather
than dropping it. Dates are ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`. Money is a float in the hotel's
currency.

**4. Implement the writes, each with the guard.**

```python
from core.adapters.base import guarded_write

@guarded_write("pms_write")
def add_note(self, reservation_id: str, text: str) -> dict:
    ...
```

The decorator is not optional. Without it your adapter can write while the agent
is in shadow mode, which defeats the entire safety model. The action name should
be one of the values in `review.require_approval_for`.

**5. Register it.** One line in `core/adapters/__init__.py`:

```python
REGISTRY["pms"]["yoursystem"] = "core.adapters.pms_yoursystem:YourSystemPMS"
```

Then set `systems.pms.adapter: yoursystem` in `config/hotel.yaml` and run
`make doctor`.

### Rules that matter

- **`ping()` never raises.** It returns `HealthCheck(ok=False, ...)` with a hint.
  A broken adapter must still produce a readable doctor table.
- **Every write is decorated.** No exceptions.
- **Rate limits belong in the adapter.** Use `core/adapters/_http.py:RateLimiter`.
  Retry 429 and 5xx with backoff; never retry a 4xx.
- **Never log a credential.** `core/log.py` masks anything whose key looks like a
  secret, but do not rely on it.
- **Redact on ingestion.** Any guest-written text goes through
  `core.redact.redact()` before it is stored or shown to a model.
- **Write a test.** Copy `tests/test_core_adapters_mock_csv.py`. It should run
  with no network: feed your parser a fixture, check the dataclass that comes out.

### `core/` is shared

`core/` is identical in all 28 agents in this family. If you change something in
`core/`, keep it generic - a hotel-specific tweak belongs in `tools/` or in your
own adapter file, not in the shared runtime.
